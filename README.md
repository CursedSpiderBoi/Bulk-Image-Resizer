# Image Resizer Script

## Introduction

This Python script allows you to resize all images in a specified directory to a desired width and height.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system
- The `Pillow` library installed. You can install it using:

    ```bash
    pip install Pillow
    ```

## Usage

1. **Download the Script**

   Save the Python script (e.g., `resize_images.py`) on your computer.

2. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**

   Open a terminal or command prompt window.

3. **Navigate to the Script's Directory**

   Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/script/directory
   ```

    Run the Script

    Execute the script by running the following command:

    ```bash

    python resize_images.py
    ```

    Follow the Prompts
   ```
   Enter the path to the directory containing your images when prompted.
   Input the desired width in pixels.
   Input the desired height in pixels.
   ```

    Wait for Completion

    The script will resize all images in the specified directory, and you'll see progress messages for each resized image.

    Completion Message

    Once the resizing process is complete, you'll see a message indicating that the resize is finished.

### Example

Suppose you have a directory named images containing your pictures. Here's how you would use the script:

  Open a terminal or command prompt.

  Navigate to the directory where you saved the script:

    cd path/to/script/directory

Run the script:

```
python resize_images.py
```

  Follow the prompts, entering the path (images), width, and height.

  Wait for the script to complete the resizing process.

  You'll see a completion message, and all images in the images directory will be resized.

## Limitations

File Type Support: The script currently supports a few common image file extensions (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .bmp)
That's it! You have successfully resized your images using the provided Python script.
